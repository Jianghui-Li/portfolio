Design process:
I used some words as an array.
I wrote "baldum vs yorn" in the array and make sure I wrote it carefully. Additionally, I have to make sure the location of each character on the correct spot.
I built a main loop that runs 20 times for 20 chances for you to guess, and a sub loop runs 14 times for 14 guesses because there are only 14 correct characters in total.
Try not to guess the same letters you used before, but you still can guess the same letters if you want to loes.
After you tried for 20 times, you program will decide if you are right or not.

Writing the program:
#include"stdafx.h"
int main(void)
{
	char A[14] = { 'b', 'a', 'l', 'd', 'u', 'm', ' ', 'v', 's', ' ', 'y', 'o', 'r', 'n' }; /*The words that I would use, and there are 14 letters in total*/
	char B[14] = { '-','-','-','-','-','-','-','-','-','-','-','-','-','-' }; /*The 14 blanks that matches the 14 letters.*/
	char letter;
	int i, j, k=0;
	for (i = 1; i <= 20; i++) /*The main loop that will make you guess 18 times.*/
	{
		printf("\n Guess a new letter:");
		scanf_s(" %c", &letter);
		for (j = 0; j <= 13; j++) /*The sub loop that runs 14 times.*/
		{
			if (A[j] == letter && j != 6 && j != 9) /*There are two blanks in these three words.*/
			{
				B[j] = letter;
				printf("%c", B[j]);
			}
			else if (j == 6 || j == 9) /*There are two blanks in these three words.*/
			{
				B[j] = ' ';
				printf("%c", B[j]);
			}
			else {
				printf("%c", B[j]);
			}
		}
	}
	for (j = 0; j <= 13; j++)
		if (A[j] <= B[j])
			k++;
		if (k = 14)
			printf("\n Wow! You are good at this!"); /*If you can guess these words using 18 times or less, it shows.*/
		else
			printf("\n Wasted! The correct answer is baldum vs yorn"); /*If you cannot guess thoes words using all 18 times, it shows.*/
	return 0;
}
