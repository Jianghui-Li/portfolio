Overall performance of the two hotels was compared and reported, performance-related factors were identified, future revenue predictions were made as well as recommendations on both hotels were suggested based on current data.</P>

Since Pokémon video games are ability-based, and legendary pokémon normally have the best abilities; hence, we are interested in finding those legendary pokémon and how all pokémon’s abilities, types, and stats, etc. are correlated or related to whether they are legendaries or not.</p>

                    <p class="text">The American Heart Association recommends no more than 25 grams of added sugar a day for women and 36 grams for men. But do you know that one large salted caramel hot chocolate contains almost 90 grams of sugar? I used two datasets that include the nutritional information for Starbucks’ food and drink menu items until 2019 to create some viusalizations about both general nutrition facts, nutrition facts correlations, and nutrition facts rankings.</p>

The data attributes include student grades, study time, parents’ information, and school-related features.
